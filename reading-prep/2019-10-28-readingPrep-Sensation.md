#Reading Prep: Sensation

#### Emma Farman

1. Does the popularity of the podcast support this idea of phonology overtaking print technology? Does this text predict or elude to the pocket telephone as an idea that has brewed in the minds of inventors for the last century? How has this vision come to fruition and how has it not? "no progress gas ever been made without changing the place of some of our ills"
2. What is the benefit of collapsing disability through design? i.e having a book that both sighted and bling people can read, having wearable technology that assists (dis)abled bodies? What does it mean to "erase" this disability?
3. Does the "font" or "voice" of an audio recording affect the meaning of the text? How does tone change the textual meaning? What does it actually mean to "read" something?
