#Reading Prep: Algorithm

#####Emma Farman

1. Where does the obsession to standardize and "sciencify" the humanities? We see it beginning here with Babbage and it remains prevelant today: think humanics or whatever. WHy is that? Does it have benefits? Drawbacks?
2. On page 171 there is a footnote that describes how steam sped everything up, from fashion to physical travel. What continues to speed things up today? Why are we going so fast?
3. Could the Chinese Room thought experience be used to explain how humans other than ourselves may be robots? How can we be sure that everyone is not just mechanically giving outputs so to speak?
