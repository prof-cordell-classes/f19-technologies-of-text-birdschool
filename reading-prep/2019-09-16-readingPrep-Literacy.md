#Chapter Two Reading Response: Literacy

#####Emma Farman

1. Literacy is not decreasing, simply what we consider literacy is changing - like how the papyrus and parchment were in simultaneous use for a long time, so too will print materials and code? When will code take over, if ever?

2. How has the advent and spread of reading and writing changed the human psyche? Will technological developments prove to be as big of a change? Or is it just a small change like the switch from papyrus to parchment.

3. Science fiction and technological progress flings us into new, unknown, discomfort. How do we balance this desire for newness and our aversion to discomfort? How are these two opposite feelings at odds with one another and how do they work together in the name of “progress”?
