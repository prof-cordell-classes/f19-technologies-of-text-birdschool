1. Are the use of emoticons and emojis a shift back to the use of print for emphasis? In the way that using small caps or bold or italics in a printed document, how does using an emoticon or an emoji change the meaning? Is it easier or harder to understand? Would a manicure be an emoji or a punctuation mark?

2. What is the purpose behind archival work if most documents survive on accident anyway? Is there a purpose in the curation of history or is it all a bit futile? Or out of our control? This is in reference to the sheer amount of indulgences or tweets etc. What is kept and what is not?

3. How did the transformation of the book as "something to be bought" affect they we think about the ownership of knowledge? And the creation of this knowledge?
