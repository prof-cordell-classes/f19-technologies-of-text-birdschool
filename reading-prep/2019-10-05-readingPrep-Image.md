#Chapter Five Reading Response: Image

#####Emma Farman

1. Does Aldous Huxley referring to Blake's line, "If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is: infinite," in his book *The Doors of Perception*? In what ways would mind altering drugs and vast advancement in human communications technology have an effect on perception? How does the way we communicate influence the processes of the mind?
2. The book became a tool for what borsuk calls "social justice." Did printing press technologies need to become more widespread and cheaper for this evolution to occur? Are the elite in charge of the spread of information/knowledge? Are the elite the only driving force of "social justice?"
3. Under Carrion's definition "A book is a space time sequence." Does this make DNA a book? Does a book become a book in the process or being read? Once those moments converge in time through a reader's perspective?
