# Lab Report: Binding

#####Emma Farman

##Process Description
This lab was the culminating piece of several labs we have completed this semester. First we created coded twitter bots to randomly generate poetry. Then we learned how to set type and use the printing press to create printed copies of our poetry. This last lab is the final stage of this three part project, where we finally bound our printed pages of poetry together into small booklets. 

The binding process itself was generally very simple, but involved many different tools that I was unfamiliar with. We were given two sheets of poetry and the cover, a bone folder, a pencil, and an awl. After folding the pages with our smooth bone folder, we measured five equidistant holes in the spine of the booklet using our awl (pokey tool) and a cradle to hold the pages in place. Threading the pages together was my personal favorite part. Once the threading was done, the book was complete! A fairly straightforward and simple method for creating small bound booklets. 

##Observations
This lab was one of the simpler and more straightforward compared to others we have done this semester. This project was only comprised of a few sheets of paper which meant that the binding process is inevitably simpler than binding an actual book of many pages. When binding a book with many pages the binding process is much more intricate, but this simple process can be used to make small booklets, notebooks or even zines. 

This lab was a useful life skill building activity I think because I can see myself using these techniques again either to make zines for myself or my friends, or to create little notebooks. I would be interested in learning how to bind and repair thicker books, primarily because my Complete Works of William Shakespeare just fell off of the shelf and the binding completely fell apart, but I feel like this lab was a necessary and important intro into the world of book binding.

##Analysis
This lab, along with the destruction of the binding of my large book, were both interesting reminders of the fragility of the codex and the physical binding that is necessary for texts to be to even be conceived. By conceived I mean specifically the theology of the text, or our mental picture of what a text is. Without the physical representation of the page or the codex, we would not be able to conceive of the text in the ways that we do, and all of this is reliant upon the binding that stiches it all together.

This reminds me of our work with The Book, and also the work that I've been doing in Proseminar this semester talking about the book as object. When we think of the materiality of the text, specifically the physical codex the text is bound within, it raises a lot of questions about what the text really is.

Recently we have been discussing different theories regarding where the meaning of the text is derived. If meaning comes from the object the text is in, then every part of the reader's experience of that object must be considered when thinking of its meaning. These thought experiments regarding textuality, the object of the text, and meaning are fascinating, and its when I am able to interact with the physicality of the text, such as binding a small codex, I am better able to understand the book as an artifact, and object, and a relic instead of just as a story.
