#Lab Report: Multisensory Reading

#####Emma Farman

##Process Description
This particular lab was all about honing our observational skills instead of the usual activity oriented lab. We used one of the lesser utilized senses of touch as our main tool of observation. This observation was meant to be a form of reading through our sense touch. We moved from station to station using our finger tips to feel 3D printed models of diffrent forms of material reading before braille became standardized. 

Each station may have *felt* different, but the ways that it felt different were difficult to describe. The five stations had different elements or shapes to them, but what those shapes said or represented were nearly impossible to distinguish. Our notes from the exercise mostly consisted of questions and descriptions of the shapes of the lines in comparison to the empty space on the page. 


##Observations
While going through the stations we expected to at least have some idea of what we were feeling, but there is a big difference between feeling a shape and understanding its meaning. The hardest part for me was creating a mental image of the shapes I was feeling. I suppose that relying on this mental image so to speak of what I was reading with my fingertips is a crutch that I assume is needed as a sighted person but in reality is not how this sensory form of reading works at all. This is the problem I think with sighted people attempting to create the universal page of raised letter forms, primarily because they rely upon this idea of visual conceptualization in order to understand the text.

It was much simpler to discern texture rather than shape for me personally. Our notes consisted mostly of the sharpness or softness of the lines, their spacing, and theirgeneral contour. But again it was difficult to actually understand what it was I was feeling. From our readings I expected this understanding to be a little more straight forward, but now I understand that touch based reading is an entirely different mode, and one needs to be familiarized with it in the same way as one learns to read visually. In this way the activity complicated my initial understanding.

##Analysis
This lab focused on comparing different types of multisensory reading, specifically touch based. By comparing them side by side, we were able to see the faults in many of these methods for the "universal page". This was especially evident in the stations that contained picture elements as they are much more focused on the visual reader than the tactile one. The idea of the "universal page" is a fascinating development in print technology, however, and 99% Invisible's piece on the invention (or movement I suppose) was illuminating. It is rather inspiring to think of a system of writing that is accessible to all, but in reality this method, being created by sighted people, overlooks a lot of the complications and hinderances it causes for the blind. This is because, as the "Universal Page" points out, reading happens in the brain. This is something I never truly thought about until interacting with other modes of reading. Many different types of tactile reading were invented around the time that Boston Line Type was created, but many of them seemed helpful for reading outside, but inside the brain made things more difficult to process. 


This gets to Hendren's idea that all technology is assistive, and when someone tries to make a specific technology for one specific disability, often they miss a lot of important elements that need to addressed. Any universal anything will have its drawbacks for everyone. I think that this activity really showed how able bodied individuals should be educated in these different forms and methods of reading and writing. Through education I think that we will be better able to assist any bodied people, and understand how language, reading, and writing, interact with people from all walks of life and how we can make it better.
